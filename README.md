As our final capstone project, we developed a new build for Spring University. The design had gone through a UX development process and comps were delivered to us. 
In two weeks we built out the website, which included using custom plugins, post-types and custom fields. 
A lot of effort went into the programs pages, which was spearheaded by Jane and is an intergral part of the website. 

I worked on the home page, which included writing jQuery to create custom control buttons for the header video, as well as looping over post types with a foreach PHP loop.
I developed the Events page, which is an archive page of the Events custom post type. I developed the Locations and Contact Us pages, which in turn used MapBox and Custom field suite to create a form. 

I also created the 3 step application form using Contact Form 7, and required some problem solving to accomplish. 

Rony devleoped the About page, again using Custom Field Suite, and worked on the page header and menu system.
